# Introduction
<span class='anchor' id='-introduction'></span>

I am a first-year M.Sc student at [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/) of [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) advised by Professor [Yu-Feng Li (李宇峰)](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/liyf/index.htm), and a member of [LAMDA Group (机器学习与数据挖掘研究所)](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/CH.MainPage.ashx), which is led by Professor [Zhi-Hua Zhou (周志华)](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/index.htm).

I got my B.Sc. degree in School of Artificial Intelligence in June 2024 from Southeast University. In the same year, I was admitted to pursue for a M.Sc degree in Nanjing University without entrance examination.
